Answer to Forward Motion Static and Dynamic Content Module Questions
Forward Motion - Status and Dynamic Content 

Section 1 What is Static and Dynamic Content?
Do you know what the key differences between static and dynamic pages are?
Static pages are hard coded, and rendered as-is. The client would request to the server, and from the server, the source code given back is unchanged. Dynamic content can be different and change on each request. For example, different users for the same social media site will log in, but their newsfeeds will be different because the client requests to the server will have different results.
In the following scenarios, determine whether static content would suffice, or dynamic content/data would be needed.
An e-commerce website with users, products, orders, etc.
This would be a dynamic page. 
A personal website for yourself that highlights your skills, interests, and portfolio for potential employers.
      This would be a static page. 

Section 2 Static Site Generators 
Do you know what an SSG is and what it can be used for?
An SSG is a Static Site Generator, and is used to output static sites from dynamic writing. The code is written dynamically and it is published statically. 
What are some use cases of the JAMStack?
In order for something to be considered using the JAMStack, the server must serve the client static pages. This lends itself to numerous use cases, such as an app that needs fast loading times. Because all the served files are static, this means the app will load very fast. Another use case is if you are concerned with scalability in your app. Because the JAMStack allows you to serve files off of static hosting, that will provide you great (theoretically infinite) scalability. 

Section 3 SPA vs. MPA
What are some benefits of a SPA? What are some cons?
Some benefits of SPA is that it feels closer to a native app; the speed and responsiveness of the site is much snappier. Also, you can have a decoupled frontend. However, it has hard to optimize SPAs with SEOs. 
What are some benefits of a MPA? What are some cons?
MPAs are more easily optimized for SEOs and there are more tech/frameworks to choose from when building your web app. However, the loading times and responsiveness of the app wonâ€™t be as fast. 
If one of your main business requirements is use experience (UX), specifically page load time, is SPA or MPA better suited? 
SPA is better suited because if a main business requirement is UX, we want the page to feel as responsive and snappy as possible. SPAs will give this functionality as opposed to MPAs.
